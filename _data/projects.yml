  rundown: Certified Kubernetes Distribution using kubeadm atop an openSUSE MicroOS base system

    Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications.
    Kubic uses kubeadm to provide an easy way of configuring a Kubernetes cluster across multiple machines, while our MicroOS base keeps your operating system updated automatically, with fully atomic rollbacks if required.
